# Money Flow Index (MFI)
 Money Flow Index (MFI) is a movement indicator used in technical analysis that looks at time and price to measure the trading pressure â€” buying or selling. It is also called volume-weighted Relative Strength Index (RSI), as it includes volume, unlike RSI, which only incorporates price.

## Key features

- The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical indicator that generates overbought or oversold signals using both prices and volume data.

- An MFI reading above 80 is considered overbought and an MFI reading below 20 is considered oversold, although levels of 90 and 10 are also used as thresholds.

- A divergence between the indicator and price is noteworthy. For example, if the indicator is rising while the price is falling or flat, the price could start rising.
