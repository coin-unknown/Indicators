# Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)

The **Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)** is a trend-following technical indicator developed by Perry Kaufman. It adjusts its sensitivity to price changes based on market volatility, making it useful for smoothing price data and filtering out market noise.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Adjustments**: AMA adapts to market conditions by using a variable smoothing constant. This allows the indicator to react quickly to market trends while minimizing false signals during sideways markets.
- **Sensitivity to Volatility**: The smoother the market (less volatility), the slower the AMA will move, filtering out the noise. In contrast, in volatile market conditions, the AMA will respond faster to price movements.
- **Trend Detection**: AMA is particularly useful in identifying trends and spotting reversals.

## Calculation

The formula for AMA involves several steps, including determining the efficiency ratio (ER), which measures the market's trend strength relative to volatility.

1. **Efficiency Ratio (ER)**:  
   The ER is calculated by dividing the absolute price change over a period by the sum of the absolute price changes for each bar within the same period.
   
   \[
   ER = \frac{\text{Price Change (Abs)}}{\text{Sum of Absolute Price Changes}}
   \]

2. **Smoothing Constant (SC)**:  
   The smoothing constant adjusts based on the ER. A higher ER leads to a faster reaction, while a lower ER results in slower smoothing. The smoothing constant is calculated as:

   \[
   SC = \left( ER \times (FastSC - SlowSC) + SlowSC \right)^2
   \]

   Where:
   - **FastSC**: Faster smoothing constant (commonly set to 2)
   - **SlowSC**: Slower smoothing constant (commonly set to 30)

3. **AMA Formula**:  
   Once the ER and SC are determined, the AMA is calculated as:

   \[
   AMA_{today} = AMA_{yesterday} + SC \times (Price_{today} - AMA_{yesterday})
   \]

## Usage

- **Identifying Trends**: AMA can be used to determine the overall trend direction. When the price is above the AMA, it indicates a bullish trend; when below, it suggests a bearish trend.
- **Reversal Signals**: A significant change in AMA's direction may signal a potential market reversal.
- **Filtering Noise**: By adjusting to market conditions, AMA helps traders avoid reacting to minor price fluctuations and focus on significant trends.

## Settings

Typical parameters for the AMA indicator include:
- **Fast Period**: 2 (for faster response)
- **Slow Period**: 30 (for slower smoothing)

## Conclusion

The Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is a powerful tool for trend-following strategies, providing a dynamic approach to adjusting sensitivity based on market volatility. Itâ€™s widely used by traders to detect trends and reduce the impact of market noise, helping them make more informed trading decisions.
