# Pivot Point Levels (Classic / Woodie / Camarilla / Fibonacci)
Pivot Point Levels are used to determine the overall trend of the market. The classic method uses the high, low, and close prices of the previous trading period to calculate the pivot point. The Woodie method adds the high and low prices of the previous trading period to the close price. The Camarilla method uses the high, low, and close prices of the previous trading period, as well as the high and low prices of the current trading period. The Fibonacci method uses the high, low, and close prices of the previous trading period, as well as the high and low prices of the current trading period, and applies Fibonacci retracement levels.
