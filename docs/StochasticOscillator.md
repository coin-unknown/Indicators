# Stochastic Oscillator (KD)
The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period. It is calculated using the following formula:

```
%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
%D = 3-period SMA of %K
