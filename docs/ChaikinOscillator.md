# Chaikin Oscillator
The Chaikin Oscillator is a momentum indicator that measures the accumulation-distribution line, comparing it to a moving average of the accumulation-distribution line over a certain period. It is calculated using the following formula:

```
Chaikin Oscillator = (ADL - ADL(n)) / ADL(n)
