/**
 * Circular buffers (also known as ring buffers) are fixed-size buffers that work as if the memory is contiguous & circular in nature.
 * As memory is generated and consumed, data does not need to be reshuffled â€“ rather, the head/tail pointers are adjusted.
 * When data is added, the head pointer advances. When data is consumed, the tail pointer advances.
 * If you reach the end of the buffer, the pointers simply wrap around to the beginning.
