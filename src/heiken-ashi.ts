/**
 * Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks are an offshoot from Japanese candlesticks.
 * Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks use the open-close data from the prior period
 * and the open-high-low-close data from the current period to create a combo candlestick.
 * The resulting candlestick filters out some noise in an effort to better capture the trend.
 * In Japanese, Heikin means “average” and Ashi means “pace” (EUDict.com).
 * Taken together, Heikin-Ashi represents the average pace of prices.
 * Heikin-Ashi Candlesticks are not used like normal candlesticks.
 * Dozens of bullish or bearish reversal patterns consisting of 1-3 candlesticks are not to be found.
 * Instead, these candlesticks can be used to identify trending periods,
 * potential reversal points and classic technical analysis patterns.
