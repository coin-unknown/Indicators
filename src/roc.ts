/**
 * The Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator, which is also referred to as simply Momentum,
 * is a pure momentum oscillator that measures the percent change in price from one period to the next.
 * The ROC calculation compares the current price with the price “n” periods ago.
 * The plot forms an oscillator that fluctuates above and below the zero line as the Rate-of-Change moves from positive to negative.
 * As a momentum oscillator, ROC signals include centerline crossovers, divergences and overbought-oversold readings.
 * Divergences fail to foreshadow reversals more often than not, so this article will forgo a detailed discussion on them.
 * Even though centerline crossovers are prone to whipsaw, especially short-term,
 * these crossovers can be used to identify the overall trend.
 * Identifying overbought or oversold extremes comes naturally to the Rate-of-Change oscillator.
